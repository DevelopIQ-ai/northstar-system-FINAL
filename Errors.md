# Sentry Logging Improvements - Scratchpad

## Current Sentry Implementation Analysis

### Existing Issues Found:
- [x] Basic Sentry setup without environment differentiation
- [x] No specific tags for different components  
- [x] Health endpoints not tagged separately
- [x] Missing context for debugging
- [x] No user/session tracking
- [x] Limited error categorization

### Components to Enhance:
- [x] Main FastAPI application (app.py) - ENHANCED WITH FULL SENTRY
- [x] LangGraph workflow (bid_reminder_agent.py) - ENHANCED WITH FULL SENTRY
- [x] Authentication flows (auth/) - ENHANCED WITH FULL SENTRY
- [x] API clients (clients/) - ENHANCED WITH FULL SENTRY
- [x] Database operations (email_tracker.py) - ENHANCED WITH FULL SENTRY

### Detailed Analysis:
**app.py**: 
- Basic Sentry with FastAPI/Starlette integrations
- Uses environment from ENVIRONMENT var but no dev/prod distinction
- No tags for health vs workflow operations
- No context/user tracking
- No specific error categorization

**bid_reminder_agent.py**:
- Basic Sentry with logging integration
- No workflow-specific tags or context
- No node-level error tracking
- Missing operation categorization

**Missing Sentry in**:
- graph_api_client.py - Email API operations
- buildingconnected_client.py - Project/invitation API operations  
- auth_helpers.py - Token management and OAuth flows
- email_tracker.py - Database operations

### Proposed Sentry Tags Structure:
- environment: development/production
- component: api/workflow/auth/client/database
- operation: health_check/bid_reminder/email_send/token_refresh
- severity: low/medium/high/critical

### Error Categories to Track:
- Authentication failures
- API client errors
- Database connection issues
- Workflow state errors
- Email delivery failures
- Token refresh problems

## Implementation Progress:
- [x] Environment-based configuration - COMPLETED
- [x] Core workflow tagging - COMPLETED
- [x] API client error tracking - COMPLETED
- [x] Authentication flow monitoring - COMPLETED
- [x] Database operation logging - COMPLETED
- [x] Health endpoint separation - COMPLETED

## COMPREHENSIVE SENTRY ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETED

### 1. Centralized Configuration (sentry_config.py)
‚úÖ **NEW FILE CREATED**: Centralized Sentry configuration with:
- Environment-based setup (development vs production)

- **Breadcrumb Tracking**: Lifecycle events, test results, token refresh
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception capture with context

### 3. Enhanced Workflow Engine (bid_reminder_agent.py)
‚úÖ **UPGRADED**: Complete workflow monitoring:
- **Node-Level Tracking**: Individual Sentry context for each workflow node
- **Performance Monitoring**: Transaction tracking for entire workflow
- **Operation-Specific Tags**: Authentication, project queries, email sends
- **Breadcrumb Trails**: Detailed workflow progression tracking
- **Error Context**: Rich error information with workflow state

### 4. Enhanced API Clients
‚úÖ **Microsoft Graph Client (graph_api_client.py)**:
- **Request/Response Tracking**: Every API call monitored
- **Authentication Error Handling**: Specific 401 error tracking
- **Email Operation Monitoring**: Detailed email send tracking
- **Performance Context**: API endpoint and method tagging

‚úÖ **BuildingConnected Client (buildingconnected_client.py)**:
- **Project Query Monitoring**: Detailed project fetching tracking
- **Invitation Fetch Tracking**: Comprehensive invitation retrieval monitoring
- **Pagination Monitoring**: Track multi-page API operations
- **Error Classification**: API errors vs unexpected errors

### 5. Enhanced Authentication (auth/auth_helpers.py)
‚úÖ **UPGRADED**: Complete OAuth flow monitoring:
- **Token Lifecycle Tracking**: Refresh, rotation, and storage monitoring
- **Authentication Flow Context**: Microsoft Graph vs BuildingConnected
- **Error Classification**: Invalid grants, network errors, rotation failures
- **Security Event Tracking**: Token rotation and storage operations

### 6. Enhanced Database Operations (email_tracker.py)
‚úÖ **UPGRADED**: Complete database monitoring:
- **Operation-Specific Context**: Create, insert, select operations
- **Email Tracking Monitoring**: Success/failure logging with context
- **Performance Tracking**: Database connection and query monitoring
- **Error Classification**: Connection vs query vs data errors

### 7. Key Features Implemented

üè∑Ô∏è **Comprehensive Tagging Structure**:
- `environment`: development/production (auto-detected)
- `component`: api/workflow/auth/client/database
- `operation`: health_check/bid_reminder/email_send/token_refresh/etc.
- `severity`: low/medium/high/critical
- Custom tags for specific operations

üîç **Rich Error Context**:
- Operation-specific error capture
- Component identification
- Stage/flow tracking
- Detailed metadata for debugging

üìä **Performance Monitoring**:
- Transaction tracking for major operations
- Breadcrumb trails for operation flow
- Timing and performance data
- Success/failure metrics

üåç **Environment Awareness**:
- Development vs production configuration
- Different sampling rates by environment
- Enhanced debugging in development
- Production-optimized settings

### 8. Separation of Health vs Workflow Operations

‚úÖ **Health Endpoint**: Now properly tagged as:
- `operation`: "health_check"
- `component`: "api"
- Separate transaction tracking
- Test suite execution monitoring
- Email report tracking

‚úÖ **Workflow Operations**: Now properly tagged as:
- `operation`: "bid_reminder_workflow"
- `component`: "workflow"
