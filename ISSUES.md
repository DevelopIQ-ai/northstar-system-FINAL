# Production Edge Cases & Issues

This document outlines critical edge cases that could cause issues when the Bid Reminder Agent is deployed to production with a daily CRON job for a large company.

## 🔐 Authentication & Token Management Edge Cases

**OAuth Token Failures:**
- Refresh tokens expire unexpectedly (Microsoft: 90 days, Autodesk: varies)
- Token rotation failures when Autodesk provides new refresh tokens
- Encryption/decryption failures due to corrupted keys or tokens
- Simultaneous token refresh attempts causing race conditions
- Missing or invalid environment variables on deployment

**Client Credential Issues:**
- Client secrets expire or get rotated without updating environment
- OAuth apps get disabled or permissions revoked
- Tenant-specific token URL changes for Microsoft Graph

## 🌐 API Rate Limiting & Throttling

**Microsoft Graph API:**
- Rate limits: 10,000 requests per 10 minutes per app
- Email sending throttling (varies by tenant)
- Concurrent request limits causing 429 errors

**BuildingConnected API:**
- Unknown rate limits (not documented)
- Potential per-project query limits
- Pagination request throttling

## 📊 Data Consistency & Size Issues

**Project Data:**
- Projects with invalid or missing `bidsDueAt` dates
- Projects with date formats not matching ISO 8601
- Extremely large numbers of projects (>10,000) causing memory issues
- Projects with missing required fields (id, name)
- Duplicate project IDs across responses

**Bidding Invitations:**
- Missing or invalid contractor email addresses
- Invitations with null/empty names or contact details
- Circular references in bid package -> invite relationships
- Pagination failures causing incomplete invitation lists

## 📅 Date/Time Calculation Edge Cases

**Timezone Issues:**
- Server timezone vs. project timezone mismatches
- Daylight saving time transitions
- Date calculations during leap years
- Projects with due dates in different timezones

**Date Range Logic:**
- Projects due at midnight (00:00) boundary conditions
- Projects with due dates exactly 5-10 days from now
- Negative days calculation when projects are overdue
- Invalid date formats causing parsing failures

## 📧 Email Delivery Failures

**Recipient Issues:**
- Invalid or bouncing email addresses
- Recipients with full mailboxes
- Corporate email filters blocking automated emails
- Contractors with multiple email addresses

**Content Issues:**
- HTML email rendering problems
- Very long project names breaking email formatting
- Special characters in project names causing encoding issues
- Missing or invalid "linkToBid" URLs

## 🔄 Pagination & Large Dataset Issues

**Memory Consumption:**
- Loading thousands of projects into memory simultaneously
- Pagination loops running indefinitely due to API bugs
- Reaching the 50-page limit causing incomplete data
- Large JSON responses causing memory exhaustion

**Performance Issues:**
- Sequential API calls taking too long (>30 minutes)
- CRON job timeout killing the process mid-execution
- Railway deployment resource limits (memory/CPU)

## 🚨 Network & Connectivity Issues

**API Availability:**
- Microsoft Graph API outages
- BuildingConnected API maintenance windows
- Intermittent network connectivity issues
- DNS resolution failures

**HTTP Request Failures:**
- SSL certificate issues
- Connection timeouts
- Proxy or firewall blocking requests
- HTTP 5xx errors from external APIs

## 💥 Partial Failure Scenarios

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Some projects fail to process but others succeed
- Email delivery fails for some recipients but not others
- Authentication succeeds for one API but fails for another
- Workflow continues processing despite errors

**State Inconsistency:**
- Emails sent but logging/tracking fails
- Projects processed but invitation retrieval fails
- Successful workflow execution but result reporting fails

## 🏗️ Deployment & Environment Issues

**Railway Deployment:**
- Environment variables not properly set
- Container resource limits exceeded
- Deployment timezone different from expected
- Python dependencies missing or outdated

**CRON Job Reliability:**
- Job starts but doesn't complete due to timeouts
- Multiple instances running simultaneously
- System clock drift affecting timing calculations
- Insufficient permissions for log file creation

## 🔍 Logging & Monitoring Gaps

**Silent Failures:**
- Errors swallowed by exception handlers
- Incomplete logging of API responses
- Missing monitoring of email delivery status
- No alerting when workflow fails completely

## 🎯 Business Logic Edge Cases

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Same contractor invited multiple times per day
- Contractors receiving emails for projects they've already submitted bids for
- Multiple bid packages for same project causing spam

**Email Frequency:**
- Contractors receiving too many emails (>50 per day)
- Projects with extremely short bid windows (<5 days)
- Overlapping CRON job executions sending duplicate emails

## 🔧 Critical Mitigation Recommendations

### High Priority (Address First)
1. **Implement circuit breakers** for API calls
2. **Add comprehensive health checks** with alerting
3. **Implement email deduplication** logic
4. **Add request retry logic** with exponential backoff  
5. **Set up monitoring dashboards** for all external dependencies

### Medium Priority
6. **Implement graceful shutdown** handling for CRON job timeouts
7. **Add data validation** for all API responses
8. **Create backup authentication methods** for token refresh failures
9. **Implement rate limiting** to respect API quotas
10. **Add comprehensive error reporting** with context preservation

### Additional Considerations
- **Token expiration monitoring** with proactive renewal alerts
- **Email delivery status tracking** and retry mechanisms  
- **Resource usage monitoring** for memory and CPU limits
- **Timezone handling** standardization across all date operations
- **Pagination safety limits** to prevent infinite loops
- **API response validation** to catch malformed data early

## 🚨 Most Critical Edge Cases

The most critical edge cases to address first are:

1. **Authentication token failures** - Would cause complete system failure
2. **API rate limiting** - Could block all operations during peak usage
3. **Memory exhaustion** - Could crash the application on large datasets
4. **Email deduplication** - Could spam contractors and damage company reputation
5. **CRON job overlaps** - Could cause resource conflicts and duplicate processing

These issues would affect all customers and could cause significant business impact if not properly handled.
